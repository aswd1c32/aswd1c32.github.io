// Variables store data
// the let keyword means it can be changed, the var keyword means you, the coder, are old, and the const keyword means that the data cannot be changed
// there are a lot of data types
// Your lines of code should end with a semicolon, because although it is not required, it's a good practice
let booleanExample = false; // true or false, called a boolean
let numberExample = 420.69; // signed integer or decimal, just called a number
let stringExample = "Bonjour !\n"; // text, called a string, \n is the <br /> of javascript
let arrayExample = [false, stringExample, 420.69]; // list, called an array, variable names can be used in place of their values, because what's the point of it otherwise
// arrayExample[0] is the first element, arrayExample[1] is the second, ...
let objectExample = {// THESE CURLY BRACES ARE REQUIRED
  arr: arrayExample,
  "qu√©": 6
};

// objectExample.arr is the same as objectExample["arr"] and they are both the array
// logic is useful
// the if statement checks if something is true
// ! means not
// && means and
// || means or
// == means is
// != means is not
// < and > are what they mean in math
if(3 > 2)
{// these curly braces are not required if it's just one line, ex: if(true) console.log("stuff");
  // math works
}
else if(3 == 2) // else if statements run if none of the above if or else if statements ran
// don't worry about logic messing things up, anything 
{
  // math does not work
}
else // else statements are just "run this code if none of the above logic is true"
{
  // math still doesn't work
}

// functions can do two things: one is execute code, the other is return a value. This one will do both.
function addSquares(num1, num2)
{// THESE CURLY BRACES ARE REQUIRED
  console.log(num1 + " " + num2); // print the two numbers to the console (you can find it with ctrl+shift+i and common sense), separated by a space
  // + is add, - is subtract, * is multiply, / is divide, and % is modulo
  return (num1 * num1) + (num2 * num2); // returns a value, addSquares(5, 3) can be used just like any other value
}

// DOM stuff now
// this is how you mess with the actual page using javascript
// there's a built-in object, document, that allows you to do so
let cats = document.getElementById("cats"); // returns the element with the id "cats"
cats.innerHTML = "777cateee"; // sets the contents of the tag to 777cateee, you can put tags into there, \n will not be counted as a line break
